In most cases, you don't need to scrape us. Our data is available for bulk download in our Data Store: https://projects.propublica.org/data-store/ . Many data sets there are free. Some come with a small charge to help defray our costs for creating the data sets.

You can contact us if the data you want isn't available on the Data Store (Really! Just ask!)
